## ‚ú® Features

- Integrations with fzf for fuzzy search
- Supports directory, session and tree-mode preview
- Supports directory-based session creation with find and zoxide integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- find
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (>= 3.2)
- [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (>=0.35.0)
- Optional: [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)

## üíª Install

### Installation with [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

Add the following line to your `.tmux.conf`.

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'percygt/tmuxinoicer'
```

### Installation via [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) `overlay`

Add tmuxinoicer as a flake input:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    tmuxinoicer.url = "github:percygt/tmuxinoicer";
  };
  outputs = { tmuxinoicer, ... }: { };
}
```

Then, use the flake's `overlay` attribute:

```nix
{
  outputs = { tmuxinoicer, nixpkgs, ... }:
  let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      overlays = [ tmuxinoicer.overlays.default ];
    };
  in
    # You can now reference pkgs.tmuxPlugins.tmuxinoicer.
  { }
}
```

After that, `tmuxinoicer` can now be used as a normal tmux plugin within
`nixpkgs`.

### Guide

Modify the list of default values above by setting the desired values in
`.tmux.conf`.

```tmux
set -g <variable> <value>
```

#### `@tmuxinoicer-extras`

`find` and `zoxide` are both enabled by default. If you want to display only
`find` result.

```tmux
set -g @tmuxinoicer-extras "find"
```

#### `@tmuxinoicer-find-rooter`

The result of `find` is based on the value of `@tmuxinoicer-find-rooter`. If the
value is `.git`, it will search for directories that has `.git` directory in it.
If you want the result to display all directories set this:

```tmux
set -g @tmuxinoicer-find-rooters ""
```

#### `@tmuxinoicer-find-base`

`@tmuxinoicer-find-base` is a comma-separated list of directories and their
depths to search for directories based on rooters.

Each element of the list is in the following format:

```bash
/path/to/dir[:<min depth>[:<max depth>]]
```

- If you omit `<min depth>` and `<max depth>`, they are set to `0` and `0`
  respectively.
- If you omit `<max depth>`, it is set to `<min depth>`. (means `<min depth>` is
  the exact depth)

If you omit the depth or explicitly set it to `0`, the directory itself will be
added as a project. In that case, you can add the directory as an input even if
it contains no rooter.

For example, if you want to search for [ghq](https://github.com/x-motemen/ghq)
repositories as an input:

```tmux
set -ag @tmuxinoicer-find-base ,"$(ghq root):3"
```

For example, if you want to add `~/.config/nvim` itself as an input:

```tmux
set -ag @tmuxinoicer-find-base ,"${HOME}/.config/nvim"
```
